# CSS Week Five Independent Project
_*Epicodus CSS Capstone Independent Project
Project Name: Kerr Calendar
Project Author: Suzi Rubino*_

##Project’s Purpose or Goal:

A small client of mine, Kerr Contractors, a local heavy civil engineering firm, is in the process of preparing to hand over leadership and/or ownership. They have been updating their website, collateral and brand messaging.

Each year, as a client gift, I've created custom calendars on 13” x  19” photo paper. This year they have asked for 20 and want to pay a premium for them. The calendars incorporate a mission statement logo I developed and images taken by one of their founders (an amateur photographer).

The goal of this project is to supply them with a similar web version of this calendar, that can also be edited and printed out.  Although there are many excellent calendar applications out there, this functionality will serve as a “note to self” for current, timely events. It will also remind this client that I have updated my skills and can help them with web projects.

The main client contact is also the photographer and IT specialist so this may be a good way to get real world, corporate experience with small-scale server/front-end applications.

The first stage of this project is design only, to show client and see if he is interested in taking it further.

1. Full-year calendar with client provided images as background which also incorporates logo and mission logo
2. Event/Holiday notification
3. Area for client to add their own events.

5. Responsive full-page monthly calendar with company brand imagery
