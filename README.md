# CSS Week Five Independent Project
_*Epicodus CSS Capstone Independent Project
Project Name: Kerr Calendar
Project Author: Suzi Rubino*_

##Project’s Purpose or Goal:

A small client of mine, Kerr Contractors, a local heavy civil engineering firm, is in the process of preparing to hand over leadership and/or ownership. They have been updating their website, collateral and brand messaging.

Each year, as a client gift, I have been preparing custom calendars on 13” x  19” photo paper. This year they have asked for 20 and want to pay a premium for them. The calendars incorporate a mission statement logo I developed and images taken by one of their founders (an amateur photographer).

The goal of this project is to supply them with a similar web version of this calendar, that can also be edited and printed out.  Although there are many excellent calendar applications out there, this functionality will serve as a beautiful (civil engineers think big yellow equipment and huge piles of dirt are beautiful) “note to self” for current, timely events. It will also remind this client that I have updated my skills and can help them with web projects.

The main client contact is also the photographer and IT specialist so this may be a good way to get real world, corporate experience with small-scale server/front-end applications (does it sound like I know what I’m talking about? I don’t, but I hope to find out).


What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, Drupal modules and/or other resources will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

SASS - css preprocessor
CSS libraries: Bourbon/neat
Fonts and font libraries: Material Icons, Google Fonts, Font Squirrel
Material Icons
Javascript library: JQuery
Adobe Illustrator
Adobe Photoshop


If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.



What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

More knowledge of Javascipt and server side storing capabilities

Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?

Yes, I would like a resource on how to research what skills I need to complete these goals (server-side storing capabilities -- am I even using the right term?) A way that user can keep and save info.

This project, if fully completed, would include:


1. Full-year calendar with client provided images as background which also incorporates logo and mission logo
2. Event/Holiday notification
3. Area for client to add their own events.
4. List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
5. Responsive full-page monthly calendar with company brand imagery
6. Current date highlighted
7. Date, time and event notification at bottom of page
8. Sample of calendar like this here: https://codepen.io/adriancarayol/pen/yyVNqW


#List the absolute minimum features _*(Minimum Viable Product)*_ the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

- [ ] 12 month calendar with client images and logo
- [ ] Responsive date grid and images
- [ ] date event notification if user clicks or hovers on applicable date


#What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, Drupal modules and/or other resources will you use to create this Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?

- SASS - css preprocessor
- CSS libraries: Bourbon/neat or Materialize (maybe)
- Fonts and font libraries: Material Icons, Google Fonts, Font Squirrel, webfont kits for client brand font (officina serif)
- Javascript library: JQuery
- Adobe Illustrator
- Adobe Photoshop

#If MVP finished what will be developed next in descending order of importance:

- [ ] Start work on animated function to allow date event entry

- [ ] Start work on today's date javascript functionality

- [ ] Create functionality for storing event

- [ ] User interface would look like this: https://codepen.io/ciprianionescu/pen/JYPwwL

#What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- More knowledge of Javascipt and server side storing capabilities
